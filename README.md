# Predator-Prey Ecosystem Simulation

An interactive three-species predator-prey model demonstrating population dynamics in different environmental conditions.

## Features

- **Three-Species Model**: Producer (üå±), Prey (üê∞), and Predator (ü¶â) populations
- **Environmental Conditions**: Toggle between "Average Rainfall" and "Drought" conditions
- **Real-time Visualization**: Live population bars and time-series charts
- **Lotka-Volterra Dynamics**: Mathematical modeling of species interactions

## How to Use

1. Open `predator-prey-model.html` in a web browser
2. Select environmental conditions (Average Rainfall or Drought)
3. Click "Start" to begin the simulation
4. Watch population dynamics unfold over 100 months
5. Use "Reset" to restart with different conditions

## Environmental Effects

- **Average Rainfall**: Normal ecosystem carrying capacity
- **Drought**: All population sizes reduced by 50% to simulate resource scarcity
